# Contribution guidelines

Before making a pull request, please make sure of the following:
* The Url(s) you want to add do not already exist
* Your url is correctly placed under the appropriate technology
* Improvements of the same Url are encouraged!
* The pull request needs to have a descriptive title
* If the technology of your url does not exist, feel free to create a new entry in table of contents
* Make a separate pull request for each of the url
* Use the following format `|[Name]|(link_to_url)|Details|`
* If you are sharing a multiple url of same entities, use the following format:
    ```
            * |[Name]|1.(link_to_url)<br>2.(link_to_url)|Details|
    ```
* Check the spelling and grammar
* Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one
* Remove any trailing whitespaces
* Links must be pointing straight to the urls, no URL shorteners.
